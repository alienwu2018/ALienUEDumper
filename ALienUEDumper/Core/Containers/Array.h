/**
 * Templated dynamic array
 *
 * A dynamically sized array of typed elements.  Makes the assumption that your elements are relocate-able;
 * i.e. that they can be transparently moved to new memory without a copy constructor.  The main implication
 * is that pointers to elements in the TArray may be invalidated by adding or removing other elements to the array.
 * Removal of elements is O(N) and invalidates the indices of subsequent elements.
 *
 * Caution: as noted below some methods are not safe for element types that require constructors.
